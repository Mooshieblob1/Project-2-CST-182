# Issues Fixed âœ…

## Problem 1: CSV Not Loading by Default

**FIXED:** The app now automatically loads your `transactions.csv` file on first startup when no localStorage data exists.

**How it works:**

1. App checks for existing data in localStorage
2. If no data exists, automatically loads from `/static/transactions.csv`
3. Saves loaded data to localStorage for future visits
4. Your existing transactions are now available immediately!

## Problem 2: Page Interaction Freezing

**FIXED:** Resolved infinite loop in reactive subscriptions that was causing the app to freeze after a few clicks.

**What was fixed:**

- Simplified the transaction store subscription pattern
- Removed circular dependencies in reactive statements
- Added proper async handling for CSV operations
- Added timeout buffers for store operations

## New Features Added

### ðŸ”„ Reset & Reload Button

- **Location**: Data Tab â†’ Import Section â†’ "Reset & Reload"
- **Function**: Clears all current data and reloads fresh from CSV
- **Use case**: If app gets stuck or you want to restart with clean CSV data

### ðŸš€ Improved CSV Loading

- **Auto-load on startup**: No manual action needed
- **Better error handling**: More informative error messages
- **Async operations**: Prevents UI freezing during data operations

## Testing the Fixes

1. **Visit http://localhost:5173**
2. **CSV should load automatically** - You'll see your transactions immediately
3. **Test tab switching** - Should be smooth and responsive
4. **Test interactions** - All buttons and filters should work without freezing

## If You Still Experience Issues

1. Go to **Data** tab
2. Click **"Reset & Reload"** button
3. This will force a clean restart with fresh CSV data

Your app should now work smoothly with all features functional! ðŸŽ‰
